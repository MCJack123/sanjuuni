# sanjuuni
Converts images and videos into a format that can be displayed in ComputerCraft. Spiritual successor to [juroku](https://github.com/tmpim/juroku), which is hard to build and isn't as flexible.

## Installation
### Windows
Download the latest release from the [releases tab](https://github.com/MCJack123/sanjuuni/releases). This includes the built binary, the Lua player programs, plus all required libraries.

### Linux
#### Arch Linux (AUR)

sanjuuni is available in the Arch User Repository; use your favorite AUR helper to install it:
```sh
yay -S sanjuuni
```

The `sanjuuni-git` package is the bleeding edge version of sanjuuni.

#### Nix/NixOS

sanjuuni is available in the Nixpkgs unstable branch. To use it, update your Nix channels and launch a shell with sanjuuni in your path:

```sh
nix-channel --update
nix-shell -p sanjuuni
# You will now be in a bash shell with sanjuuni on your path.
sanjuuni --help # Use sanjuuni like normal
exit
# sanjuuni is no longer on the path; execute nix-shell again to get it back.
```

Alternatively, if your project uses sanjuuni in a script, add `sanjuuni` to `mkShell.buildInputs`.

```nix
with (import <nixpkgs> {});
mkShell {
  buildInputs = [
    bash
    sanjuuni
  ];
}
```

Nix support is maintained by [Tomodachi94](https://github.com/tomodachi94). For any issues with the Nix package itself, please contact him by opening an issue on [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/new/choose).

## Building
Requirements:
* C++17 or later compiler
* FFmpeg libraries
* Poco (Foundation and Util required; Net/NetSSL optional)
* zlib (usually required by Poco)
* OpenCL (optional, for GPU support)
* GNU `sed` (installed by default on Linux; `brew install gsed` on Mac)

To build:
```sh
./configure
make
```

On Windows, use the Visual Studio solution with vcpkg to build.

### Playback programs
* `32vid-player.lua` plays back separate-stream 32vid video/audio files from the disk. Simply give it the file name and it will decode and play the file. (Deprecated)
* `32vid-player-mini.lua` plays back combined-stream 32vid video/audio files from the disk or web in real-time. Simply give it the file name or URL and it will decode and play the file in real-time.
* `bimg-player.lua` displays BIMG images or animations. Simply give it the file name and it will decode and play the file.
* `raw-player.lua` plays back raw video files from the disk. Simply give it the file name and it will decode and play the file.
* `websocket-player.lua` plays a stream from a sanjuuni WebSocket server. Simply give it the WebSocket URL and it will play the stream, with audio if a speaker is attached.

## Formats
* The Lua file output creates a simple script that displays the image/animation, and if there's only one frame, waits for the return key to be pressed. The data is stored as plain blit table(s), so it can be copied to another file as desired with the display code.
* The raw file output creates a file based on [CraftOS-PC Raw Mode](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/docs/rawmode). Each frame packet is stored on one line, and the first two lines contain a version header and the FPS. (If the FPS is 0, this is a plain image.)
* The blit image file output creates a file based on [the BIMG specification](https://github.com/SkyTheCodeMaster/bimg). This is similar to Lua output, but stored in a serialized table for reading by other files. It also supports animations, but no audio.
* The 32vid file output creates a file that uses the 32vid format described below, which is a binary file that stores compressed and optimized versions of the video and audio data in multiple streams.
* The HTTP server output starts an HTTP server that serves a single player file at the root (`/`), which can be run through `wget run`. The metadata of the stream is stored at `/info` as a JSON file with the fields `length` and `fps`. Each frame is stored in a separate URL under a `video` or `audio` folder, e.g. `/video/0` returns the first frame of the video, and `/audio/0` returns the first second of audio.
* The WebSocket server output starts a WebSocket server that sends frames over the connection. It uses a simple request/response protocol, with the first character of the frame indicating the request type, and an optional parameter follows the character. For `v` and `a` commands, success is indicated by the message being a binary message. (Failure messages will always be exactly `"!"`, but successful messages may be `"!"` as well!) The following commands are available:
  * `v<n>`: Returns the `n`th frame of video as a Lua script that returns the image + palette
  * `a<n>`: Returns one second of audio starting at the `n`th sample in unsigned 8-bit PCM
  * `n`: Returns the number of video frames available
  * `f`: Returns the framerate of the video
* The WebSocket client output functions the same as the WebSocket server output, but connects to an existing WebSocket server instead of hosting its own. This allows reverse-server connections and use of pipe servers.

### 32vid file format
The 32vid format consists of a number of streams, which can hold video, audio, or subtitles/overlay text. Each stream may be compressed as specified in the flags. Video data is stored in an optimized format for drawing characters, using only 5-6 + 8 bits per character cell, and pixels and colors are split into two planes to optimize for compression algorithms. Audio data is always at 48000 Hz, and (in the current version) is unsigned 8-bit PCM or DFPWM.

#### Streams
| Offset | Bytes | Description                |
|--------|-------|----------------------------|
| 0x00   | 4     | Size of data               |

    * 3 bits for monitor Y (0-7)

As of sanjuuni 0.5, the old-style format with separate streams is deprecated. It remains available for legacy applications, but new features will only be supported in the combo stream format.

#### Video data
Video data is stored as a list of frames, with each frame consisting of packed pixel data, then colors. Pixel data is stored in a bitstream as 5-bit codes. The low 5 bits correspond to the low 5 bits in the drawing characters, and the character can be derived by adding 128 to the value.

Pixels are grouped in tokens of 5 bytes/8 characters. If the characters cannot fit in a multiple of 8 characters, the token is right-padded with zeroes to fit. After pixel data, each cell's colors are written with one byte per cell, with the high nibble storing the background and the low nibble storing the text color. Finally, the palette is written as 16 sets of 24-bit RGB colors.

The length of a frame can be determined with the formula `ceil(width * height / 8) * 5 + width * height`.

For multi-monitor frames, the first 4 bytes contain the width and height of the encoded image (in characters), since the global width/height is different from the per-frame width/height.

#### Custom video compression
32vid implements a custom compression format for faster and more efficient compression. When custom compression is enabled, each frame is stored as a pair of screen and color blocks, each encoded using Huffman coding. The screen block uses 32 symbols corresponding to the 5-bit drawing characters, and the color block uses 24 symbols, with the low 16 representing the 16 colors, and the last 8 representing repeats of the last literal value from 2 to 256. (For example, a sequence of 8, 18, 19 means to repeat color 8 25 times.)

The code tree is encoded using canonical Huffman codes, with 4 bits per symbol for the length of the code. Therefore, the screen block's table is 16 bytes in size, and the color block's table is 12 bytes. Decoding is accomplished by reading the table, constructing a tree from the canonical bit lengths, and then reading the bits in order from most significant bit to least.

Unlike uncompressed frames, the color block is stored in two sections: the foreground colors are coded first, and then the background colors. This is to allow better run-length encoding. Each frame is compressed separately as well, as opposed to LZW and DEFLATE compression.

#### Custom video compression - ANS
This is a variant of the normal custom format, but uses asymmetrical numeral systems to encode the data. This compresses similarly to the Huffman coding used in normal custom compression, but is easier to decode as it doesn't need to step through each bit (all bits are read at once). The image is also encoded backwards as required by the ANS algorithm.

#### Subtitle events
| Offset | Bytes | Description                          |
|--------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 4     | Frame number to show the text on     |
| 0x04   | 4     | Number of frames to display for      |
| 0x08   | 2     | X position of the text in characters |
| 0x0A   | 2     | Y position of the text in characters |
| 0x0C   | 1     | Color set for the text (BG+FG)       |
| 0x0D   | 1     | Flags (reserved)                     |
| 0x0E   | 2     | Text length                          |
| 0x10   | *n*   | Text                                 |

Subtitle streams are arranged as sequences of subtitle events. Events MUST be ordered by start time; decoders are not required to respect events that are out of order.

#### Combined audio/video streams
This stream format is used to encode audio and video together, which allows real-time decoding of video. It's split into frames of video, audio, and subtitles, which are each prefixed with a 4 byte size, and a 1 byte type code using the stream type codes. A frame only contains a single event of its type: video is one single frame, subtitles are one single event, and audio is a single chunk (which can be any length, ideally around 0.5s). The length field of the stream is used to store the number of frames in the stream. If the file contains a combined stream, it SHOULD NOT contain any other type of stream, except an index if available.

#### Combined stream index table
This chunk type stores an index table for the audio/video stream, which can speed up seeking in the file. It contains a single byte with the number of video frames per entry, and afterwards is split up into 32-bit words, where each word is an offset into the file for the start of that video frame. For example, if the first byte is 60, the first word will point to video frame 0, the next will point to frame 60, then frame 120, and so on. Note that this counts video frames specifically - the index will never point to an audio or subtitle frame.

Index tables MAY be stored at either the beginning or end of the file. If your application is looking for an index table and it is not the first stream, seek past the combo stream and check whether it's after the stream. sanjuuni stores the index at the end for efficiency.

## Multi-monitor usage
sanjuuni 0.5 adds support for natively creating multi-monitor images and videos. These images are higher-quality than using a program like staple on a huge single image, as each monitor is independently processed to create a unique palette per region of the image. Multi-monitor can be enabled by adding the `-M`/`--monitor-size` flag to the command line. The parameter can take an optional argument used to set the size of each monitor - this defaults to 8x6 monitors at 0.5x scale, but if you want to use a different scale, or you changed the CC config's monitor size limit, you can pass a string in the form of `<width>x<height>` or `<width>x<height>@<scale>` to change it.

Multi-monitor is only supported in Lua, BIMG, and 32vid output formats. If you use BIMG, you'll need to use the player that comes with sanjuuni, as it uses a special extension of the BIMG format that isn't implemented in other players.

When you load a multi-monitor image for the first time, you'll need to calibrate the display setup to ensure the right monitors are used. A screen will appear on the main monitor to indicate which monitor in the array it's looking for. To calibrate, simply right-click on each monitor in order from left to right, top to bottom, using the same size as is displayed on screen (i.e. if your array is 3x3 but the image only needs 2x3, don't right-click on the rightmost monitor column). Once completed, the image or video will be displayed on the array, and the configuration will be saved in the `settings` API for later use.

The default multi-monitor output doesn't account for screen borders, which means that while all the pixels in the image will be shown, the image may appear distorted across the edges of each monitor. To resolve this, pass the `--trim-borders` option, which will account for the space taken up by the borders.

## Library usage
It's possible to use much of the core of sanjuuni as a library for other programs. To do this, simply include all files but `sanjuuni.cpp` in your program, and include `sanjuuni.hpp` in the source you want to use sanjuuni in. Then create a global `WorkQueue work` variable in your source, which is used to delegate tasks to threads. Then use any of the functions in `sanjuuni.hpp` as you need. Basic documentation is available in the header.
